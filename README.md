# Sceloporus_2021_Climate_Hydration

This repository houses all the data and code associated with the publication "Hydration and Evaporative Water Loss of Lizards Change in Response to Temperature and Humidity Acclimation" by Savannah Weaver, Tess McIntyre, Taylor van Rossum, Rory Telemeco, and Emily Taylor, published by the Journal of Experimental Biology in 2023 (doi:10.1242/jeb.246459).

Each of the "wrangling" files take in the sometimes numerous files with raw data, assess technical replicates, and format data classes. All the wrangled data is then saved as .RDS files, which are used in the analysis files. In "analysis_capture", we assess the baseline variation in cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL), plasma osmolality, and hematocrit. In "analysis_experiment", we quantify the effect that acclimation to different climate conditions had on CEWL, plasma osmolality, hematocrit, and body mass/condition. In "analysis_HOBO_stats", we calculate summary statistics of the temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit that lizards experienced during climate acclimation. The publication focuses on the experiment, and the only analysis_capture component in the paper is the relationship between CEWL and plasma osmolality. The results folders contain the figures and tables presented in the paper, which were exported from the analysis files.

Readers of the paper and users of this code are encouraged to email questions to Savannah Weaver at savannahjweaver@gmail.com.
