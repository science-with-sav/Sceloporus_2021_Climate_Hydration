This repository houses all the data and code associated with the publication "Differing Acclimation Responses for Hydration and Evaporative Water Loss of Lizards in Response to Temperature and Humidity" by Savannah Weaver, Tess McIntyre, Taylor van Rossum, Rory Telemeco, and Emily Taylor, published by __ in 2023.

Each of the "wrangling" files take in the sometimes numerous files with raw data, assess technical replicates, and format data classes. All the wrangled data is then saved as .RDS files, which are used in the analysis files. The "weather_trends" file assesses differences in weather over time throughout this and a similar study. Each analysis file performs a different set of statistics and figures. In "analysis_capture", we assess the baseline variation in cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL), plasma osmolality, and hematocrit. In "analysis_experiment", we quantify the effect that acclimation to different climate conditions had on CEWL, plasma osmolality, hematocrit, and body condition. In "analysis_HOBO_stats", we calculate summary statistics of the temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit that lizards experienced during climate acclimation.
